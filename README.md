# Flare-on11 CTF Challenge Solutions

The Flare-On contest always features a diverse array of architectures, but with a strong representation of Windows binaries. This yearâ€™s contest may be the most diverse ever, with 10 challenges covering architectures including Windows, Linux, JavaScript, .NET, YARA, UEFI, Verilog, and Web3. Yes, you read that correctly, there is a YARA challenge this year. The challenges are often designed to represent Reverse Engineering challenges the FLARE team has encountered on the frontlines of cybersecurity.
